# SudokuSolver
The Sudoku Solver project aims to create a Python program that can solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties. Sudoku is a popular number puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub grids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.
